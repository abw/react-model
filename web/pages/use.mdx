# Use

Wrapping a component in the `Consumer` higher order component is
perfectly cromulent, but the preferred way to access context data these days
tends to be via a use hook.

Consider this model, much the same as the previous examples.

<Snippet
  file="use/model.ts"
  expand
/>

The `Model` function returns a use hook as the `Use` property.  It's generally
not advised to use it without giving it a name that matches the recommended
practice for React hooks, that the name should start with `use`.

In this example, we export it as `useCounter`.

We can then import that hook and call it anywhere inside a component to access
the model data.

<Snippet
  file="use/use.tsx"
  expand
/>

## Typescript Notes

If you're using Typescript then the properties returned by the use hook will
all be properly typed.  What a time to be alive!
