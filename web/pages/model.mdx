# Model

The `Model` function takes your model component as the first argument.

Your function can accept optional configuration properties passed as a single
object.  It should return a single object containing the items that you want
it to expose.

<Snippet
  file="model/example.ts"
  expand
/>

## Typescript Notes

If you're NOT using Typescript then there's nothing more to worry about.
You're good to go.

If you ARE using Typescript but your model function doesn't accept
configuration properties, or if all the properties have default values then
Typescript can automatically infer the type.  It just works.

<Snippet
  file="model/defaults.ts"
  expand
/>

If your model has required or optional properties that don't have a default
value then Typescript can't automatically infer the types.  In this case
you should define a type or interface describing them

<Snippet
  file="model/interface.ts"
  highlightLines="1-4,9"
  expand
/>

If your model returns values that Typescript can't automatically infer the
types for then you can also define an interface or type for the return value.

<Snippet
  file="model/proptypes.ts"
  highlightLines="6-10,12"
  expand
/>

Note the use of the `SetState` utility type on line 8.  This is a type that
can be imported from `@abw/badger-model`.  It's a more readable alias for the
somewhat cryptic React type for a `useState` setter function, which in this
case would be `React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<number>>`.
