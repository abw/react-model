# Volume Control

This example is much the same as the amplifier demo on the home page, but
we'll go into it in a little more detail.  Click on the buttons or drag
the slide to change the volume.
<App/>

## Model

This is the component that defines the model for this demo.

<Source
  code={VolumeSrc}
  caption="Volume.ts"
  expand
/>

The `volume` (and corresponding `setVolume` function) are defined using
`useState()` with the initial value set from the optional `initialVolume`
property.

We define some additional functions of convenience, `oneLouder` and
`oneQuieter` to increment and decrement the volume respectively, and
`goToEleven` for when you want that push over the cliff.

The return value from the function is an object containing all the items
that we want to share with model consumers.

The final step is to pass this `Volume` function to the `Model` higher order
component imported from `@abw/react-model`.  This returns an object containing
a `Provider`, a `Consumer` and a `Use` hook which we alias as `useVolume`.
These are the named exports from the module.

## Provider

The `Provider` is imported from `Volume.ts` and used to define a scope for
this model.

Along with some general layout and styling (provided by CSS classes
from <BadgerCSSLink/>) it contains three further components: `Slider`,
`Buttons` and `Display`.  All these component will be able to access the
data model from the Provider.

In this example, we're setting the `initialVolume` to `10`.  The properties
set on the `Provider` are forwarded to the `Volume` model function.

## Consumer

There are two ways for components to access the model.  The first is to wrap
a component using the `Consumer` higher order component.  The component will
be passed all the model items as properties.  The `Slider` component renders
a range slide input.  It uses the `volume` and `maxVolume` values and the
`setVolume` function to update the volume when the slide is dragged.

  code={SliderSrc}
  caption="Slider.tsx"
  highlightLines="3,4,12"
  expand
/>

The `Buttons` component renders three buttons which, when clicked, call the
functions to decrease, increase, or turn the volume all the way up to eleven.
Now how we also use the `volume` and `maxVolume` values to disable the
corresponding buttons when the volume is already at the lowest or highest
value.

  code={ButtonsSrc}
  caption="Buttons.tsx"
  highlightLines="6,9,12"
  expand
/>

## Use

The second way is to access model data is to call the `useVolume` hook from
within a component.  In the `Display` component we only need the `volume` and
`maxVolume` items to display.

  code={DisplaySrc}
  caption="Display.tsx"
  highlightLines="4"
  expand
/>
