# Children

OK, I admit it.  I wasn't telling the whole truth when I said this implements
an "MPCU" pattern.  There's a bit more to it than the `Model`, `Provider`,
`Consumer` and `Use` hook.  There's also a `Children` component which gets
returned in the object when you call the `Model` function.

The purpose of the `Children` component is to allow you to embed functions
directly into your React code.  My personal opinion is that this isn't usually
a good idea.  But it can be useful for quick hacks, tests, or in other
exceptional circumstances.

A function defined *immediately* inside the `Children` component (i.e. not
nested inside any other element or component) will be called as a model
consumer.  That is, it will be passed all the properties returned by your
model function.  You can include any other React content inside the `Children`
component and it will be rendered as usual.

## Typescript Notes

If you're using Typescript then the properties passed to your functions
will be properly typed.

What more could you ask for?  Other than a pony.
