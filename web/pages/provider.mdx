# Provider

The generated `Provider` will forward all properties to your model function.

Consider this model which has a required `initialCount` property and optional
`className`.

<Snippet
  file="provider/model.js"
  expand
/>

If you're not using Typescript then you're not going to get any warnings
if you forget to provide the required `initialCount` property, or if you
mistype the optional `className` property.  It just works, for better or
worse.  The model function will receive the properties that you provide.

<Snippet
  file="provider/provider.jsx"
  expand
/>

## Typescript Notes

If you're using Typescript then the `Provider` properties will be typed to
match the properties of your model.  You'll get a Typescript error if you
forget to define the required `initialCount` property, mistype the `className`
property, or provide any other properties that it wasn't expecting.

These are both fine:

<Snippet
  file="provider/provider-ok.tsx"
  expand
/>

These are not.  Typescript will tell you that you've made a mistake so your
boss or client doesn't have to.

<Snippet
  file="provider/provider-errors.tsx"
  expand
/>
