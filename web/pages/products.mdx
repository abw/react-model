# Products and Basket

Here's a more detailed example emulating an e-commerce app with a list of
products that can be added to a basket.

<Example
  Component={App}
  code={AppSrc}
  caption="Products.tsx"
  expand
/>

## Model

The model is a bit more complicated than the previous examples.

We maintain a list of products (`products` and `setProducts`) and an index
(`productIndex` and `setProductIndex`) to fetch a product by id.  The
`loadProducts` function emulates a call to an API endpoint to load the
list of products.  To keep things simple in this example, we just copy them
from the `sampleProducts` defined in lines 18 to 22.

There's a `selectProduct` function which selects a product from the index and
stores in the `product` state variable, using `setProduct`.

Then there's the `basket` and associated `setBasket` function, along with
functions to add a product to the basket (`addProductToBasket`), return the
quantity of any product in the basket (`quantityInBasket`), remove a product
from the basket (`removeProductFromBasket`) and empty the basket entirely
(`emptyBasket`).

We also define a `ready` state variable along with its corresponding setter,
`setReady`.  These would typically be used to prevent users from interacting
with the application before it's properly initialised and/or to provided
feedback to the user that something is happening in the background, e.g. by
displaying a loading message or spinner.

<Source
  code={ModelSrc}
  caption="Products.ts"
  expand
/>

As before, the function only needs to return an object containing the data
items that it wants to share with consumers.

The `Products` function is passed to the `Model` higher order component which
returns an object containing a `Provider`, `Consumer` and `Use` hook (which we
alias to `useProducts`).  These are exported as named exports.

## Layout Component

Let's look at the `Layout` component that wraps the other component.

<Source
  code={LayoutSrc}
  caption="Layout.tsx"
  highlightLines="4-6,8"
  expand
/>

This uses the `Consumer` to wrap the component so that it can access the
`ready` state variable as a property.  But there's a twist.  This component
also expects to receive a `children` property which isn't one of the data
items provided by the model.

To keep everything type safe, we define the `LayoutExtraProps` interface
that includes the `children` property as a `ReactNode`.  This is then passed
as a generic type parameter to the `Consumer` as `Consumer<LayoutExtraProps>`.
This ensures that Typescript knows that the component can receive the `children`
as well as any other data items provided by the model.

The component uses the `ready` property to display a loading message until
the model is ready to be interacted with.  At that point the `children` are
rendered.

## List Component

The `Layout` component has two children: the `List` and `Info` components.
Here's the first of those.

<Source
  code={ListSrc}
  caption="List.tsx"
  highlightLines="5-8"
  expand
/>

It uses 4 items provided by the data model: the list of `products`, any
currently selected `product`, the `selectProduct` function to select a product
by id, and the `quantityInBasket` function to determine how many of any
particular product (by id) are currently in the basket.

It renders one button for each product, including the number in the basket.
Clicking on a button selects the product.

## Info Component

The `Info` component displays information about any currently selected
`product`.  If no product is selected it displays a message inviting the user
to click on a product button to select it.

<Source
  code={InfoSrc}
  caption="Info.tsx"
  highlightLines="5"
  expand
/>

## Basket Component

The `Basket` component is rendered by the `Info` component when a product
is selected.  To demonstrate the other way of accessing the data model, this
component uses the `useProducts` hook.  It's functionality similar to wrapping
a component with the `Consumer` in that exactly the same model data items are
available.  The only difference is that the `Consumer` wrapper passes them as
properties to the component and the `Use` hook returns them as an object.

<Source
  code={BasketSrc}
  caption="Basket.tsx"
  highlightLines="6-11"
  expand
/>

It renders either of the `InBasket` or `NotInBasket` components, depending
on the product being in the basket or not.  If there are items in the basket
it renders an "Empty basket" button which will empty the basket when clicked.
Otherwise it displays a "Basket is empty" message.

## InBasket Component

The `InBasket` component shows another variation.  This uses the `useProducts`
hook to fetch the items from the data model.  It also accepts a `quantity`
property, passed to it by the `Basket` component as a short-cut.  The
`InBasketProps` interface is used to type its properties.

<Source
  code={InBasketSrc}
  caption="InBasket.tsx"
  highlightLines="3-5,7"
  expand
/>

This displays a message saying how many of the product are currently in the
basket.  An "Add one" button is provided to add another one to the basket.
A "Remove" button removes the product from the basket.

## NotInBasket Component

If the product isn't already in the basket then the `NotInBasket` component is
displayed.  This displays a message along with a button to add one to the
basket.

<Source
  code={NotInBasketSrc}
  caption="NotInBasket.tsx"
  expand
/>
